A special thanks to [Adrien Barbaresi](https://github.com/adbar) for the original Python [trafilatura](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura) library that this Dart port is based on.


## Testing and evaluating the code

Here is how you can run the tests and code quality checks. Pull requests will only be accepted if the changes are tested and if there are no errors.

- Install dependencies: `dart pub get`
- Run tests: `dart test`
- Run specific tests: `dart test test/unit_test.dart`
- Analyze code: `dart analyze`
- Format code: `dart format lib/ bin/ test/`

If you work on text extraction it is useful to check if performance is equal or better on the benchmark.


For further questions you can use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kamranxdev/trafilatura-dart/issues) and discussion pages.
